# Image Captioning Project

MDSI - 94691 Deep Learning - Autumn 2022

The aim of this project is to build a model which will take images as input and generate a short description of the image. To achieve this, an image captioning model was built. This model consists of a feature extractor model (for the images) and a sequenced-based model (to generate captions).
